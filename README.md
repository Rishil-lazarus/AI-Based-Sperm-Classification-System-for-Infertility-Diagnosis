# AI-Based-Sperm-Classification-System-for-Infertility-Diagnosis
Built an AI-based sperm classification system using a custom CNN to categorize sperm images into normal, abnormal, and non-sperm. Preprocessed and augmented data from the SMIDS dataset. Deployed as a Flask web app with a dark-themed UI for real-world infertility diagnosis support.
